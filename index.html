       <center><p style="font-size: 20px">I am a first year Media Studies PhD student at UCLA and a 2023-2025 HASTAC fellow. I focus on how the body is datafied in technology and media, emphasizing its mechanization, quantification, and commodification. Broadly speaking, my research centers on critical data studies, biometrics, science and technology studies, and somatechnics. Additionally, I am interested in experimental media art, inspired by the idea of playfulness as a form of resistance against and within the structures of cybermasculinity and Silicon Valley habitus.</p></center>
